Section 1:
->>Compiler vs Interpreter

2 methods of translation to convert one langauge to another
1st is Compiler
2nd is Interpreter

Making a dish example. Chinese recipe from which lady wants to prepare a dish
Compiling is done 1 time
Interpreting is done n times for n times making a dish

Compiler
1. 1 time translation
2. File in machine code is generated
3. Execution after translation
4. Independent Execution
5. If errors, no compilation

Interpreter
1. N time translation
2. File still in source code
3. Execution while translation
4. Execution in runtime environment
5. Partial Execution till errors


->>Python is hybrid langauge
Hybrid means compiler + interpreted langauge
2 times translation is done here
Compilation(Chinese to English) + Interpretation is done(English to hindi line by line)

See Recipe example

->> Python is platform Independent
It is portable
What is platform? Platform is OS which provides us environment to run our applications
like windows env or mac env or linux env
We run platform on a machine like mac machine etc.

Executable file depends on the platform or OS
source code is same on all machines
but transalated file/compiled source code file if runs on mac will not run on windows machine.
you need to compile/translate source code again on windows machine

If we create .pyc file which is compiled file of python(It is python bytecode), then we say it is portable
PVM(Python virtual machine) is platform dependent. it is different for windows machine, mac machine.
Its like python running inside a browser, like its own runtime environment
But python program is platform Independent

Similarly Java, C# is hybrid langauge


->> Programming paradigms - strategies for developing bigger applications
1. Procedural Programming
2. Object Oriented Programming
3. Functional Programming

0. Monolithic programming
Monolithic programming: Entire Programming is having 1 single piece
Ultimate aim is making software development easy.

1. Procedural Programming
Some instructions are kept separately and executed separately. We call them function or procedure or rountine.
We break big monolith program into smaller tasks called function or procedures.
functions are performing smaller bu complete tasks.
This is procedural programming

Related functions can be kept in a library or module
Bigger application is broker into smaller modules/functions

Also similar is modular programming.

2. Object Oriented Programming
Till now we talked only of set of instructions. We grouped them in functions or procedure or rountine.
But prgram will also have objects or variables having data
We focus on data(variables/attributes) and opeartions(functions/behaviour perform operation on data) both
And we combine above in a class.
Object is running instance of a class

Everything in Python is an object
By nature, python is Object Oriented
And it also supports Procedural programming

3. Functional Programming
It supports mathematical functions in programming.
Like in maths, you give input and get output.
Similarly here.

Python supports statistical functions so python supports AI,ML,Data science.

->>Python libraries
Libraries are ready made code which make it easier to develop applications

1. For desktop application(software which runs on single PC)
PySide
Tkinter

2. For Web application
Flask
Django
Tornado
FastAPI

3. For games
Pygame
Panda3D

4. For Database programming
SQLite
PyMySQL

5. For Datascience
Numpy
Pandas

6. Machine learning + AI
Tensorflow
Scikit Learn
