The prefix b'...' means the content is bytes, not a decoded string.

So the tail function read bytes from the file instead of text — and since you printed it without converting to text, Python prints it in its repr form, which shows bytes like:

b"...."


📌 What does file.read() do?
file.read() reads the entire remaining content of the file into memory.
If file is opened with 'r' (text mode), read() returns a string
If file is opened with 'rb' (binary mode), read() returns bytes

In your implementation:
with open(filename, 'rb') as file:
    data = file.read()
→ data will be a bytes object.

📌 What does this do?
print(data.decode(errors="replace"), end="")

Step-by-step:
Expression	Meaning
data.decode()	Converts bytes to a string using UTF-8 by default
errors="replace"	If there are invalid characters, replace them with � instead of crashing
end=""	Do not add newline after printing

So the line safely prints the text representation of the binary data.
Without .decode(), printing raw bytes shows a b'...' prefix.

📌 Why do we use errors="replace"?
Because a file might contain:
UTF-8 text
ASCII text
mixed encoding
binary data

If Python cannot decode some bytes, it would normally raise:
UnicodeDecodeError
Using "replace" avoids the crash and shows replacement characters instead — safer for logs.
