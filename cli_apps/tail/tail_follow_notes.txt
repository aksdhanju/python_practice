✅ What is Log Rotation?

Applications (especially servers) continuously write logs. If logs are never deleted or split, a single file can grow to GBs or even TBs, causing:

Disk space exhaustion

Slow tailing and reading

Difficulty archiving older logs


Log rotation solves this by:

Renaming the current log file

Creating a new empty file with the same original name


🔹 Example

Suppose an application writes logs to:

app.log

After rotation (triggered by size/time rule), it becomes:

app.log.1   (previous logs)
app.log     (new fresh file)

Over time:

app.log.3
app.log.2
app.log.1
app.log   (current writing)

Sometimes older logs are compressed too:

app.log.4.gz

So during rotation, the file content changes, but the filename (app.log) stays the same — this is why tailing requires logic to detect that the file changed behind the scenes.
