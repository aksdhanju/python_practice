->>Section 41: Lambda functions, Nested functions, Decorators


->>Function as objects
If a language treats functions as objects, they are called first class function.
In python, we treat functions as objects. So python supports first class functions.

__name__, __doc__ are properties of a function. Means function is object in python

Function has properties and we can assign a function to a variable

->> Nested functions
Function inside another function

->> Function as parameters
function takes another function as parameter
Function which takes another function as paramter is called higher order function

See example 1 and example 2 in code

We are passing functionality to arithmetic function
We are passing x and y to arithmetic function and telling it what it should do with x and y


->> Returning a function
Outer function returns inner function
In this case also, outer function is called higher order function

Question: What is higher order function?
It is a function which takes a function as parameter or returns a function

directly we cant access inner function
but we can through calling outer function
and returning inner function

->> Closure function
A function is called closure function if below 3 conditions satisfy:
1. It is a nested function
2. It returns an inner function
3. Inner function will access variables of outer function

# now below outer() is closure function
def outer():
    msg = 'Welcome'
    def inner():
        print('+'*10)
        print(msg)
        print('+'*10) 
    return inner

f = outer()
f()

# even though ref of inner function is returned but still outer function variable(msg) are being accessed


# example 3: counter closure function example

# If the inner function is modifying the variables of outer function
# then we need to declare the variable as nonlocal
# Then only inner function can modify the value. Else inner function can just read the value

->> Decorator function

Decorator function = Closure function + Function as a parameter
Earlier closure function was return function by not taking function as a parameter

def outer(f):
    def inner():
        print('+'*10) #inner function can do some processing before and after below f() call
        f() #earlier inner function was accesing variables of outer function. Now inner function is calling function passed as parameter in outer function
        print('+'*10) 
    return inner

def display():
    print('Welcome')

r = outer(display)
r()
# r is reference to inner function which is printing something, calling function and printing something


->> Lambda function
1. Also called as anonymous function


->>Called class
Like closure function
