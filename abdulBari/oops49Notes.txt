in programming, there are 2 things. data and opeartions on that data

class conatin 2 things:
1. properties: data members
2. methods: class ke member functions

class encapsulates properties and methods

l1 = list(1,2,3,4)
l1.insert(2,10)

abstraction means hiding the details. I dont know how insert
 is working/implemented behind the scenes

data is hidden. it is access through function. 
Using abstracton, we achieve data hiding.


Example 1:
Rectangle
-properties
1. length
2. breadth

-methods
1. area()
2. perimeter()

Properties are data
Methods are information. Information is processed data.
 Information we can make as function. Information related things come in function.
 Also behaviour of object come in function

Date of birth is data. Age is information.
To calculate age, one should know today's date and date of birth.

Example 2:
Car:
properties
- brand
- model
- color
- fuelType
- seats
functions
- ignitionOn()
- changeGear(num)
- accelerate()
- break()


Example 3:
Bank Account. Its an intangible object
properties
- accNum
- name
- balance
functions
- open()
- deposit(amt)
- withdraw(amt)
- close()

Example 4:
Order
properties
- orderNum
- customerDetails
- itemList
- status
functions
- selectItem(item)
- deleteItem(item)
- confirmOrder(amt)
- delivered()

->>Section 4: class variables and methods
class variables
1. Metadata of object is in class variables
2. Class variables are declared outside all methods
3. These are created only once but common to all instances of class
4. Can be accessed using object or class name
5. Used as shared data

class methods:
1. Decorator @classmethod is Used
2. They can access only class variables
3. They can be called using instances or class name
4. First parameter is cls

Just identify from examples which information belongs to instance 
and which belongs to class
Example 1:
House class. It is actually a blue print of a house
Actual house is instance of house

Information about class(plan or blueprint)
-Architect name (who made plan of house)
-Project name
-Number of houses

Information about house/instance/object
-Number of rooms
-Number of doors


class information is like Metadata
it is stored in class variables

Example 2:
Car class

Information about class
-engineer name
-company name
-number of cars manufactured
-price of a car

Example 3:
Television

Information about class
-engineer name(who designed circuitry for television)
-company name
-price of television

Example 4:
Bank Account

Information about class
-bank name
-number of accounts in bank

Example 5:
Rectangle class

Information about class
-number of rectangles



->>Section 5: static methods
static methods are different from class methods
1. These are utility methods. Provide extra facility in class
