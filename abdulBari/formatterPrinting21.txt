ASCII code range is 0 to 127 (total 128 means 2^7 means 7 bits are enough for all character)
ASCII are of 7 bits

A - 65
B - 66
.
.
Z - 90

English is Bicameral language

a - 97
b - 98 
.
.
z - 122

For every key on keyboard, there is ASCII code. There are some printable and non printable keys

0 - 48
1 - 49
.
.
9 - 57

see image on internet for other keys/characters
space - 32

13 is for enter key (non printable characters or control keys)


->>
x = 'A'
y = 65

in memory 65 is stored of both x and y
ord('A') gives 65 


chr(97) takes ASCII code and gives char in return
Ans = a

->>ASCII vs Unicode
ASCII is for English alphabets
Unicode is unified code for all the languages

Unicode is of 1 byte(8 bit), 2 byte(16 bit), 4 byte(32 bit)

For representing unicode, some formats are followed. These are unicode transformation formats.
Also called UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 formats respectively.

UTF-8 allows 1 byte, 2 byte and 4 byte. UTF-8 means minimum 8 bits(1 byte)
UTF-16 allows 2 byte and 4 byte only
UTF-32 allows 4 byte only.


s = '\u03b1'
print(s)

t = '\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3'
print(t)

Each of these codes is called code point

1 hexadecimal digit takes 4 bits 
so in total 16 bits
s = '\u0041'
ans = A

s = '\x41'
ans = A
