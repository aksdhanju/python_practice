ASCII code range is 0 to 127 (total 128 means 2^7 means 7 bits are enough for all character)
ASCII are of 7 bits

A - 65
B - 66
.
.
Z - 90

English is Bicameral language

a - 97
b - 98 
.
.
z - 122

For every key on keyboard, there is ASCII code. There are some printable and non printable keys

0 - 48
1 - 49
.
.
9 - 57

see image on internet for other keys/characters
space - 32

13 is for enter key (non printable characters or control keys)


->>
x = 'A'
y = 65

in memory 65 is stored of both x and y
ord('A') gives 65 


chr(97) takes ASCII code and gives char in return
Ans = a

->>ASCII vs Unicode
ASCII is for English alphabets
Unicode is unified code for all the languages

Unicode is of 1 byte(8 bit), 2 byte(16 bit), 4 byte(32 bit)

For representing unicode, some formats are followed. These are unicode transformation formats.
Also called UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 formats respectively.

UTF-8 allows 1 byte, 2 byte and 4 byte. UTF-8 means minimum 8 bits(1 byte)
UTF-16 allows 2 byte and 4 byte only
UTF-32 allows 4 byte only.


s = '\u03b1'
print(s)

t = '\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3'
print(t)

Each of these codes is called code point

1 hexadecimal digit takes 4 bits 
so in total 16 bits
s = '\u0041'
ans = A

s = '\x41'
ans = A

->>Escape Sequence: Special Characters

\t  is tab
\f is line feed
\r is carriage return
\n is new line
\v vertical tab
\b backspace
\a alert
\  ignore newline
\\ backslash
\' quote
\" double quote
\o octal
\x hexadecimal


\t is tab. moves cursor by 4 spaces to the right
\f is line feed. cursor moves to next line but in same column
\r is carriage return. \r brings the cursor to beginning of same/current line
Carriage was there in old type writers. brings carriage to beginnng of line
\n is new line. moves cursor to new line
\v vertical tab. Moves vertically to next line. Usually its 1 line. Similar to line feed
\b backspace.  moves cursor 1 position to the left
\a alert. you hear a beap sound
\  ignore newline
\\ backslash
\' quote
\" double quote
\o octal
\x hexadecimal


cursor or carrot
shows position where printing is done
Escape sequences are used to control the position of carrot or cursor
