We can find a substring using a pattern and patterns are defined using regular expressions
Its like finding a substring in a string but using a pattern

Use of regular expression:

1. Text processing
Search and replace text

2. Data validation
Check data in proper format

3. Extracting information
Extracting info from large text

-Sequences


->> What is pattern matching
We need to find if pattern is in string or not?

Pattern 1 = 'and'

s1 = 'android'
s2 = 'handle'
s3 = 'and'


Pattern 2 = 'com|org'

s1 = 'com'
s2 = 'org'

Pattern 3 = '[abcd]'
A string can have any of these Characters
a or b or c or d

s1 = 'a'
s2 = 'b'
s3 = 'c'
s4 = 'd'

Pattern 4 = '[abc]+'
You can take a or b or c 1 or more times

s1 = 'a'
s2 = 'aa'
s3 = 'aaaaaaaabbc'
s4 = 'b'
s5 = 'bbb'
s6 = 'babbcc'
s7 = 'cab'

So this single pattern is matching so many strings



->> (Lecture 2) How to define patterns
->> (Lecture 2) Quantifiers -> Special symbol that are used for defining patterns
In patterns we can repeat characters. Quantifiers define how many times we can repeat characters

+      1 or more times repetition is allowed
*      0 or more times repetition is allowed
?      0 or 1 (Nothing or just 1 time)
{m}    exactly m times
{m,n}  from m to n. minimum is m. maximum is n. If m, n not mentioned, m is 0 and n is infinity


->>Examples of + quantifier

a 
a

a+
aa

a+
aaa

simple bracket means all character from given brackets, you have to take and together. its and of a and b and c
So there is 1 valid strings/pattern combination
(ab)
ab

both a and b should be there and should match
(ab)+
a #no match

ab together should match. Below will not match
(ab)+
aaaaabbbb #no match

(ab)+
ababab #matches

Entire string/pattern abc should be in string/text
abc
abc

square bracket means any character from given brackets you can take once. its or of a or b or c
So there are 3 valid strings
[abc]
a

[abc]
b

[abc]
c

What if i put + now. Now i can repeat characters as many times as pobbile
[abc]+
aabc #matches

[abc]+
bcccccbbbbbccc #matches

->>Examples of * quantifier
Only difference with + is string can be empty also

[abc]*
'' #empty string valid matches

rest all are same as +
[abc]*
abcaaaa


->>Examples of ? quantifier

(abc)?
'' #empty string matches. take entire abc either 0 times or 1 times

abc string matches. take entire abc 1 times. see below
(abc)?
abc 


->>Examples of {m} quantifier

[eimt]
I can take only character from e or i or m or t. What are strings that will match? There are 4 possible combinations

[eimt]
e

[eimt]
i

[eimt]
m

[eimt]
t


[eimt]{4}
I can take only character from e or i or m or t. And I can repeat it for 4 times.
What are strings that will match? There are 4^4 = 256 possible combinations

[eimt]{4}
eimt

[eimt]{4}
eitm

[eimt]{4}
emit

[eimt]{4}
emti

[eimt]{4}
eimt

[eimt]{4}
eitm

Note: not only anagrams

[eimt]{4}
eeee

[eimt]{4}
mmmm

[eimt]{4}
mmit

->>Examples of {m,n} quantifier

[eimt]{4, 8}
[eimt]{4,}


->> (Lecture 3) Special Characters -> Special symbol that are used for defining patterns

[..]    set of possible character
[^..]   all characters except in bracket
.       any character except new line
^       beginning of a string
$       end of string
R|S     string should match either R or S pattern


->>[..]

a string can have 1 single character which is either a or b or c
[abc]

we can define range also like a to f
[a-f]

we can define range also like a to z. Means any single lower case alphabet
[a-z]


[a-zA-Z0-9]
lower case
upper case
digits
special character

for special characters we cant give a range. These are like > < = etc

one or more lower case alphabets from a to z. Thats the meaning
This below pattern represents any lower case word in dictionary
[a-z]+

Example 
[a-z]+
board #matches

[a-z]+
pen #matches


One upper case letter and greater than equal to 1 lower case letters
[A-Z][a-z]+

[A-Z][a-z]+
Ab

[A-Z][a-z]*
A

[A-Z][a-z]*
Accc


->>[^..] all characters except those in square brackets

[^a-z]+
All strings with upper case and digit and special characters


->> . any character except new line

.
Meaning of String with lower case, upper case, digit special character except new line
. means anything

.+
Meaning of String with lower case, upper case, digit special character except new line 1 
or more number of times

What if I want just .
Use escape sequence in this case before dot(.)

\.+
...........   #matches



->> ^  beginning of string

to check if string starts with http

http
i am httpbkacjkas c

^http
http://google.com

^http.+
http://google.com

here .+ dot plus means any character any number of times
So ^http.+ is used to match urls

^http.+
use http protocol #does not match as firs word is not http

->> $  end of string

com$
com

If you want something in beginning, add .+

.+com$
udemy.com


->> R|S

com|org
udemy.com

com|org
study.org


->>> Few examples of regex

Example1: Firstname Lastname
[A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+
Akashdeep Singh

Example2: Variable name in python
1. can contain only lower case char, upper case char, digits and underscore
2. can only start with lower case char, upper case char and underscore. Can not start with digit

[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*
item1

Example3: time
[012][0-9]:[0-5][0-9]
11:30

Example4: Domain name
[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.(com|org|net)$
udemy.com

->> (Lecture 4) Sequences

\d   digit. same as [0-9]
\D   non-digits #[a-zA-Z+-....] #lower case char, upper case char, special char
\w   alphanumeric [a-zA-Z0-9]
\W   non-alphanumeric #these are special characters
\s   white space. '' \t \f \r \n  
\S   non white space characters
\A   starting of a string.Same as carrot character ^
\Z   end of string. Same as $ character 


on a white paper, if we write space, then its a white space
There are other chars also which give space
Like 
\t  is tab
\f is 
\r is carriage return
\n is new line
when they are written, space is printed.
