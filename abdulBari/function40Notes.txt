Section 40: Built in functions and Modules
Lecture 1->>
Lecture 2->> Object and Attribute Function: Built in

(1)-> type(1)
<class 'int'>

We are getting class for a given object.
If object = 1 is integer, we get type as class 'int'


(2)-> isinstance(object, classinfo)
this function checks if object belongs to given class. 
In other words, is object an instance of given class
if yes, it returns true, else returns false


(3)-> hasattr(object, attribute)
to check if object/class has given attribute/method 

text = "Hello"
print(hasattr(text, 'lower')) #true
print(hasattr(text, 'search')) #false

str class has attribute/function called lower

We can check above for list, dict, set classes also


(4)-> getattr(object, attribute, default)
if a class or module has some attribute/method/function, it will give you reference to that attribute/method/function

(5)-> id()
calling it will give you unique number/id corresponding to that object

x = 10
y = 10
print(id(x))  
print(id(y))

ids will be same because both x and y are referring to same object 10


l1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
l2 = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(id(l1))  
print(id(l2))

why id of l1 and l2 are different?
Lists (l1, l2) are mutable and separately created

When you do:

l1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
l2 = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(id(l1))
print(id(l2))

Even though l1 and l2 contain the same elements,
Python creates two different list objects in memory.

That’s why:

🔹 l1 is l2 → False
🔹 id(l1) != id(l2)
🔹 But l1 == l2 → True (because their contents are equal)



(6) -> dir(object = None, /)

gives all members(functions and attributes) of a class or a module
example 
dir(list)
dir(math)

(7) -> repr(object)

text = 'Hello World'
print(repr(text)) #prints actual representation of object. does not remove quotes or anything
print(text)

(skipped)

Lecture 4->> What are modules
How to write our main modules?

In other languages, they are called libraries or packages
Modules contain predefined variables, functions, classes, objects
Means readymade things are kept in form of modules.
Related functions, attributes are kept in same module

Example In python there are modules for math, datetime, regular expression

import re

you can use alias instead of module name
import datetime as dt

instead of doing re.search, directly call search using below import statement
from re import *


from math import *

Question: How to write our main modules?
In our python program, function40 is name of our module

Every python program can act as a module.
