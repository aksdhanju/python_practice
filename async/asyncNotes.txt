ðŸ”¹ time.sleep(1)

This is a blocking call from the standard library.
It makes the current thread pause execution for 1 second.
During this sleep:
No other code in that thread runs.
If you are using it in the main thread, your whole program will be idle for that second (unless other threads exist).
So â†’ time.sleep(1) blocks the thread.

ðŸ”¹ asyncio.sleep(1)

This is the async version provided by asyncio.
It suspends the coroutine for 1 second without blocking the event loop.
While one coroutine is "sleeping", the event loop can schedule and run other coroutines.
So â†’ await asyncio.sleep(1) blocks only the coroutine, not the whole thread.
