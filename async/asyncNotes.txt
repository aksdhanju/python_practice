🔹 time.sleep(1)

This is a blocking call from the standard library.
It makes the current thread pause execution for 1 second.
During this sleep:
No other code in that thread runs.
If you are using it in the main thread, your whole program will be idle for that second (unless other threads exist).
So → time.sleep(1) blocks the thread.

🔹 asyncio.sleep(1)

This is the async version provided by asyncio.
It suspends the coroutine for 1 second without blocking the event loop.
While one coroutine is "sleeping", the event loop can schedule and run other coroutines.
So → await asyncio.sleep(1) blocks only the coroutine, not the whole thread.



🔹 Parallel example with asyncio.gather
Here all tasks sleep at the same time → total ~1 second:
asyncio.gather() or asyncio.create_task() → parallel/concurrent.

1. [worker(i) for i in range(5)] is the Pythonic shortcut for creating a list.
It’s equivalent to:
tasks = []
for i in range(5):
    tasks.append(worker(i))

worker(i) does not run immediately.
It just creates a coroutine object (like a "promise to run later").
If you don’t await them or pass them into something like asyncio.gather(),
 they’ll never execute → you will get a warning in that case

2. Meaning of *tasks
The * operator in Python unpacks a list/tuple into separate arguments.
The * operator is argument unpacking.
Example:
def add(a, b, c):
    return a + b + c

nums = [1, 2, 3]
print(add(*nums))   # same as add(1, 2, 3)


🔹 Parallel example with asyncio.create_task()
1. When you do:
tasks = [worker(i) for i in range(5)]
await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

1. worker(i) creates coroutine objects, but they don’t start running yet.
2. Only when you await asyncio.gather(...), the event loop starts scheduling them.
3. They all run concurrently, but nothing happens before the gather line.

2. When you do:
tasks = [asyncio.create_task(worker(i)) for i in range(5)]
# At this point, all tasks are already scheduled and may be running!

# You could do other work here while they run:
print("Tasks are running in the background...")

await asyncio.gather(*tasks)


1. asyncio.create_task(coro) wraps the coroutine in a Task object.
2. That task is immediately scheduled on the event loop 
— it can start running before you await gather.
3. This lets you fire off background work,
 then do something else, then later wait for completion.

Analogy 🏃
Plain coroutines (worker(i)) = “I’ve written down instructions
 for 5 workers, but they’re just waiting around until I say go.”

asyncio.create_task(worker(i)) = “I’ve hired 5 workers 
and they’ve already started working while I go do something else. 
I can check back later.”
